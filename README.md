# Liskish Wallet is not maintained anymore

I will continue to offer support on hardware wallets to LiskHQ on their official wallet.
If you were using Liskish Wallet as your main wallet, Lisk desktop will do the job also.

Branch `code` will stay for reference only.

It was a great journey. Thank you.
